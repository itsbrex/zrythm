 * to perform the actual scanning, in order to avoid blocking the main thread.
 *
 * The PluginScanManager class provides a QML-friendly API for initiating the
 * scanning process and retrieving information about the currently scanning
 * plugin. It also emits signals to notify the rest of the application when the
 * scanning process has finished and when new plugins have been discovered.
 *
 * The PluginScanManager class is designed to be used in a Qt/QML-based
 * application, and it uses the Qt threading and signal/slot mechanisms to
 * manage the scanning process.
